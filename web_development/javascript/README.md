## Javascript 

JavaScript is the Scripting Language invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Web and designed to update and change both HTML and CSS.

JavaScript can be used for calculation, manipulation of content, and validating data.

## Javascript events, eventListeners, and DOM 
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements using commands or methods provided by the Document object.
